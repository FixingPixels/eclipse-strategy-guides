## 1. Faction Identity (Why Mechanema Is Strong)

Mechanema is an **efficiency engine**.

They do not win by:

* surprise tech spikes
* massive economic snowballs
* early aggression

They win by:

* **producing ships and structures more efficiently than anyone else**
* sustaining pressure without overextending
* forcing opponents into bad economic trades

Mechanema is the faction that keeps functioning while others strain.

---

## 2. Strengths & Structural Weaknesses

### Strengths

* Extremely efficient ship production
* Strong midgame military presence
* Reliable economy
* Excellent at attrition warfare

### Weaknesses

* Limited flexibility
* Predictable strategy
* Vulnerable to being outmaneuvered
* Can struggle against extreme tech asymmetry

**Key truth:**
Mechanema doesn’t spike—it *endures*.

---

## 3. Core Strategic Principle

> **Mechanema wins by making conflict affordable for itself and expensive for everyone else.**

You don’t need to win every fight.
You need to make every fight **uneconomical for your opponent**.

---

## 4. Opening Strategy (Rounds 1–2)

### Primary Goals

1. Build a **solid production base**
2. Secure **materials and money**
3. Establish early military credibility

---

### Exploration Priorities

Top-tier tiles:

* Material-heavy planets
* Mixed material/money tiles
* Tiles that support forward production

Lower priority:

* Science-heavy but low-income tiles
* Dead tiles unless blocking

Mechanema needs **inputs**, not ideas.

---

### Influence Discipline

* Expand steadily, not explosively
* Maintain a small influence buffer
* Avoid early taxation

Mechanema’s strength comes from **stability**, not sprawl.

---

### Early Technology Picks

**High priorities:**

* Economy techs (materials first)
* Hull upgrades
* Basic computer upgrades

**Lower priority:**

* Advanced weapons
* Drive beyond basic mobility
* Early tech-track completion

Mechanema wants tech that **improves efficiency**, not flash.

---

## 5. Early Fleet Doctrine

### What to Build

* Interceptors early
* Cruisers sooner than most factions
* Cheap, durable designs

### What Not to Build

* Highly specialized ships
* Early dreadnoughts
* Fragile glass-cannon builds

Mechanema fleets should be **replaceable and persistent**.

---

## 6. Midgame Strategy (Rounds 3–5) — The Pressure Phase

This is where Mechanema becomes dangerous.

### Midgame Objectives

1. Maintain constant fleet presence
2. Pressure borders incrementally
3. Win by attrition, not annihilation

---

### Fleet Design Philosophy

* Prioritize hull over shields early
* Moderate weapons + reliable accuracy
* Designs should survive *one bad combat roll*

You are planning for **long-term presence**, not perfect fights.

---

### Combat Philosophy

Mechanema is comfortable fighting **more often than others**.

Fight when:

* you can trade evenly or better
* opponent can’t easily replace losses
* you can retreat and rebuild quickly

Avoid:

* chasing deep into enemy territory
* one-shot “all-in” attacks
* fighting tech-superior enemies head-on

Mechanema wins wars by **not caring about losses**.

---

## 7. Diplomacy & Table Presence

Mechanema diplomacy is implicit.

### What You Want the Table to Think

* “They’re solid, but not scary”
* “Fighting them is annoying”
* “There are bigger threats”

### How to Achieve This

* Maintain visible but modest fleets
* Avoid dramatic tech reveals
* Apply pressure slowly and consistently

**Mechanema thrives when underestimated.**

---

## 8. Scoring Paths for Mechanema

Mechanema scores through **steady accumulation**.

### Primary Scoring

* Controlled sectors
* Combat points (selective but consistent)
* Ambassador tiles

### Secondary

* Tech tracks (usually partial)
* Monoliths (if economy allows)

Mechanema should **never rely on a single scoring vector**.

---

## 9. Late Game Strategy (Final 1–2 Rounds)

### Late Game Priorities

* Secure borders
* Deny opponents easy points
* Convert remaining resources efficiently

### Fleet Usage

* Strong defensive positioning
* Fleets that discourage opportunistic attacks
* Minimal deep offensives

Mechanema wants opponents to realize:

> “We can’t break through cheaply.”

---

## 10. Matchup Awareness

| Opponent | Mechanema Response          |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Terrans  | Pressure early before pivot |
| Eridani  | Force midgame conflict      |
| Hydran   | Attack before tech spike    |
| Planta   | Push borders steadily       |
| Orion    | Absorb early aggression     |
| Draco    | Avoid feeding free fights   |

---

## 11. Common Mechanema Mistakes

* Ignoring mobility entirely
* Fighting tech-superior opponents too early
* Overcommitting to a single front
* Neglecting point conversion late
* Assuming efficiency alone wins games

---

## 12. Mechanema Win Condition (One Sentence)

> **Mechanema wins by being the only faction that can afford to keep fighting without breaking its economy.**

---
