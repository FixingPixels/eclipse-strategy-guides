Below is a **single, universal Anti-Mechanema Defensive Playbook**, usable by **any faction** facing Mechanema in **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy**.

This doctrine is about **breaking endurance**. You are not trying to outlast Mechanema—you are trying to **make endurance irrelevant**.

---
# Break the Loop
## Core Rule (Memorize This)

> **You do not beat Mechanema by fighting longer.
> You beat Mechanema by forcing fights to end.**

This playbook is sufficient on its own.
Faction-specific tweaks improve execution—but **this** doctrine prevents Mechanema from grinding the table into submission.

## Core Truth (Read First)

Mechanema wins by **making conflict affordable**.
If fights are repeatable and replaceable, Mechanema is happy.

Your defense must:

* **deny repeatability**
* **force decision points**
* **create losses that cannot be cycled**

If Mechanema can rebuild and re-engage next round, you failed.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* Mechanema maintains constant border presence
* You are being drawn into small, repeated engagements
* Mechanema replaces losses without slowing
* The table treats Mechanema as “inevitable but manageable”

That mindset is how Mechanema wins.

---

## Threat Model

Mechanema’s threat is:

* **attrition normalization**
* **efficient replacement**
* **pressure without commitment**

Mechanema is weakest when:

* forced into **decisive commitments**
* denied fast reinforcement
* pressured on **multiple axes** at once

---

## Primary Objective

**Prevent Mechanema from cycling fleets efficiently.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Force Mechanema to overcommit ships or influence
* Make losses *structurally painful*, not numerically large
* Shift fights from attrition → resolution

You do not need to destroy Mechanema—
you need to **break the loop**.

---

## Engagement Rules (Strict)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight **removes Mechanema’s ability to re-engage next round**, **or**
2. The fight forces Mechanema to commit capital ships, **or**
3. The fight captures or denies **production-adjacent sectors**

### Avoid fights that:

* Trade interceptors repeatedly
* Occur where Mechanema can reinforce immediately
* End with both sides “still present”

If Mechanema is still on the border next round, the fight helped them.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1 interceptor**
* Risky: **1 cruiser** (only if the fight collapses presence)
* Unacceptable:

  * Multi-round skirmishes
  * Trading cruisers repeatedly
  * Any fight that ends without positional change

Losses are acceptable only if **presence is removed**.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Identify **reinforcement paths** and threaten them
* Force Mechanema to defend **two fronts**
* Advance to production-adjacent choke points
* Delay engagement until you can **force commitment**

Do not respond automatically.
**Set the trap first.**

---

## Tech Priorities

* **Mobility** (to bypass or outflank)
* **Burst damage** (to end fights quickly)
* **Accuracy** (to punish durable builds)

Avoid:

* Defensive tech races
* Long-term economy investments
* Tech that increases your own replacement cost

You are buying **resolution**, not sustainability.

---

## Fleet Posture

* Mobile strike groups
* Positioned to threaten withdrawal routes
* Ready to disengage if commitment isn’t forced

Your fleet exists to **end presence**, not trade ships.

---

## Territory Posture

* Contest:

  * Sectors near Mechanema production
  * Choke points that support cycling
* Ignore:

  * Deep territory that invites attrition
  * Borders where Mechanema wants you to fight

Space only matters if it breaks reinforcement.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Frame Mechanema as a **slow inevitability**
* Normalize decisive action (“now or never”)
* Avoid calling for attrition coalitions

You want **focused pressure**, not endless war.

---

## Mechanema Traps to Avoid

* “We’re trading evenly”
* “They’ll run out eventually”
* Chasing durable fleets
* Fighting every probe
* Letting Mechanema choose the battlefield

If Mechanema chooses *where* fights happen, you already lost.

---

## Success Indicators

You are succeeding if:

* Mechanema commits dreadnoughts or retreats entirely
* Border presence collapses instead of cycling
* Mechanema taxes influence or delays builds
* Attacks slow because replacement is no longer trivial

---

## Exit Condition

Pivot away from this posture when **any** are true:

* Mechanema’s cycling is broken
* Another faction becomes the immediate win threat
* The game enters final scoring rounds

At that point, shift from **pressure → denial**.
