Below is a **single, universal anti-Draco defensive playbook** designed to work for **any faction** in **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy**.

This playbook’s purpose is **denial**: starve Draco of profitable exchanges while preserving your position and economy.

---
## Core Rule (Memorize This)

> **If a fight does not generate points, position, or end future fights, it is a winning move for Draco—no matter who “wins.”**

This playbook is sufficient on its own.
Faction-specific tweaks are optional—but **this** is the spine that keeps Draco from feeding.

# ANTI-DRACO DEFENSIVE PLAYBOOK

**Name:** *Starve the Harvest*

## Trigger Conditions

* Draco initiates or encourages repeated small fights
* “Even trades” are being offered or normalized
* You feel compelled to respond to provocation
* Table violence is increasing without clear territorial gain

---

## Threat Model

Draco profits from:

* **repeatable conflict**
* **loss normalization** (“it’s fine to lose a ship or two”)
* **emotional retaliation**

Draco does **not** need to win decisively.
Draco needs **you to keep fighting**.

---

## Primary Objective

**Deny Draco profitable, repeatable engagements.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Preserve your economy and influence
* Avoid becoming Draco’s preferred opponent
* Redirect violence away from your borders

---

## Engagement Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**Fight ONLY when all three are true:**

1. You fight on **defensive terrain** (your sector or fortified choke)
2. You can cap losses at or below your threshold
3. The fight yields **immediate position or points**

**Refuse combat when any are false.**

**Acceptable Loss Threshold**

* Max loss per engagement: **1 interceptor**
* Cruiser losses are **unacceptable**
* Multi-round engagements are **forbidden**

If you cannot meet these constraints: **do not fight**.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Consolidate fleets into **defensive stacks**
* Fortify or reposition to **choke points**
* Stop forward deployments
* Pass earlier to protect influence and economy

---

## Tech Priorities

* **Hull** (survivability > damage)
* **Computers** (reliable hits reduce variance)
* **Energy efficiency**

Avoid:

* Flashy weapon spikes
* Tech that signals aggression
* Track completions that paint a target

---

## Fleet Posture

* Defensive, compact, and visible
* No pursuit of retreating Draco fleets
* No deep strikes into Draco territory
* Fleets exist to **discourage**, not chase

---

## Territory Posture

* Trade low-value space for time if needed
* Defend sectors that matter for scoring or mobility
* Never die defending a sector that does not change the game

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Publicly discourage escalation (“not worth it” framing)
* Encourage conflict elsewhere
* Accept temporary non-aggression if it buys time
* Avoid language that frames the situation as a duel

---

## Draco Traps to Avoid (Critical)

* “Even trade” logic
* Retaliating to prove strength
* Chasing damaged fleets
* Turning skirmishes into wars
* Believing one decisive fight will end the problem

---

## Success Indicators

* Draco disengages or seeks other targets
* Combat frequency around you drops
* Your economy stabilizes or improves
* Table violence shifts away from your borders

---

## Exit Condition

End this defensive posture when **either**:

* Draco is no longer initiating fights with you
* The game enters final scoring rounds and fights dry up
* You can deliver a **single, decisive, point-denial fight** without enabling future conflict
