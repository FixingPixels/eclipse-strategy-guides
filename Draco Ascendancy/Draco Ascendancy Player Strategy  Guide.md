## 1. Faction Identity (Why Draco Is Dangerous)

Draco Ascendancy is a **combat-extractive faction**.

They do not win by:

* superior economy
* territorial sprawl
* tech racing

They win by:

* **profiting from combat**
* choosing fights others *can’t afford*
* converting destruction into advantage

Draco does not need to dominate the galaxy.
It needs the galaxy to **bleed**.

---

## 2. Strengths & Structural Weaknesses

### Strengths

* Gains value from combat outcomes
* Efficient point generation through fighting
* Thrives in unstable, aggressive tables
* Strong midgame leverage

### Weaknesses

* Dependent on conflict
* Vulnerable in peaceful games
* Can overfight and fall behind economically
* Requires strong timing judgment

**Key truth:**
Draco doesn’t win wars—it wins **exchanges**.

---

## 3. Core Strategic Principle

> **Draco must engineer fights that are bad for others and acceptable for itself.**

You are not looking for:

* clean victories
* territory for its own sake
* prolonged wars

You are looking for:

* **high-impact skirmishes**
* asymmetric trades
* fights that generate points or position

---

## 4. Opening Strategy (Rounds 1–2)

### Primary Goals

1. Position for **future conflict**
2. Avoid early overexpansion
3. Read the table’s aggression level

---

### Exploration Priorities

Top-tier tiles:

* Sectors adjacent to multiple players
* Tiles with Ancients you can farm later
* Forward positions that invite interaction

Lower priority:

* Deep interior tiles
* Overly safe expansion routes

Draco wants **contact**, not comfort.

---

### Influence & Expansion

* Expand conservatively
* Keep influence available for actions
* Avoid claiming space you can’t defend or exploit

Draco is punished heavily for passive sprawl.

---

### Early Technology Picks

**High priorities:**

* Hull upgrades (survivability matters)
* Computer upgrades (reliable hits)
* Energy efficiency

**Lower priority:**

* Deep economy tech
* Late-game scaling tech
* Over-specialized weapons

Draco tech should **support repeated fighting**, not perfection.

---

## 5. Early Fleet Doctrine

### What to Build

* Interceptors early
* Cheap, resilient designs
* Fleets that can fight *and* retreat

### What Not to Build

* Fragile glass cannons
* Expensive showpiece ships
* Fleets you can’t afford to lose

Your ships are **consumable assets**, not heirlooms.

---

## 6. Midgame Strategy (Rounds 3–5) — The Harvest Phase

This is Draco’s strongest window.

### Midgame Objectives

1. Create or exploit conflict zones
2. Extract points from combat
3. Stay just dangerous enough to matter

---

### Combat Philosophy

Draco fights **often**, but selectively.

Fight when:

* both sides expect losses
* opponent’s economy is tighter than yours
* you gain points or leverage regardless of outcome

Avoid:

* annihilating opponents (no future fights)
* fighting tech-superior enemies
* deep territorial conquests

Draco wants **repeatable violence**, not finality.

---

### Choosing Targets

Ideal Draco targets:

* Orion (early chaos)
* Mechanema (attrition-heavy)
* Players already weakened

Poor Draco targets:

* Tech monsters you can’t hit
* Players with strong defensive chokepoints
* Passive turtles

---

## 7. Diplomacy & Table Manipulation

Draco diplomacy is **instigation**.

### What You Want the Table to Think

* “They’re dangerous, but manageable”
* “They’ll hit someone else first”
* “This fight helps me more than them”

### How to Do It

* Encourage others to fight
* Offer to “help” in conflicts
* Avoid being the sole aggressor

Draco thrives when the galaxy is already unstable.

---

## 8. Scoring Paths for Draco

Draco scores best through **combat-linked points**.

### Primary Scoring

* Combat points
* Selective sector control
* Ambassador tiles

### Secondary

* Modest tech-track scoring
* Occasional monoliths

Draco should not rely on economy-heavy scoring paths.

---

## 9. Late Game Strategy (Final 1–2 Rounds)

### Late Game Challenges

* Fewer combat opportunities
* Higher cost of losses
* Opponents shifting to denial

### Late Game Priorities

* Secure existing points
* Pick *one* last profitable fight
* Avoid overextension

Late-game Draco wins by **choosing its final battle carefully**.

---

## 10. Matchup Awareness

| Opponent  | Draco Response                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Terrans   | Force early-mid skirmishes     |
| Eridani   | Pressure before scale          |
| Hydran    | Delay fights until tech parity |
| Planta    | Avoid deep pushes              |
| Mechanema | Attrition favors you           |
| Orion     | Let them start fights          |

---

## 11. Common Draco Mistakes

* Fighting too much
* Ending wars too decisively
* Ignoring economy entirely
* Becoming the table’s universal enemy
* Chasing territory instead of exchanges

---

## 12. Draco Win Condition (One Sentence)

> **Draco wins by turning the galaxy’s conflicts into a steady stream of points while others pay the real cost.**

---
