# Preserve the Engine

## Eridani Defensive Doctrine (Memorize This)

> **Eridani defense is not about survival.
> It is about arriving intact at the moment when resistance becomes pointless.

---
## Faction Reality (Read This First)

Eridani does not defend territory.
Eridani defends **time**.

Your economy is your win condition.
Every defensive decision should answer:

> “Does this preserve my ability to scale into the late game?”

If the answer is no, it’s the wrong defense.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* You are perceived as the economic leader
* A neighbor begins probing or skirmishing
* Multiple factions are eyeing you as a future threat
* You feel pressure to “show strength” early or midgame

---

## Threat Model

Eridani is attacked in three common ways:

1. **Early harassment** to slow your economy
2. **Midgame containment** before you scale
3. **Coalition pressure** justified by your income

Your enemies are not trying to beat you now.
They are trying to **delay you long enough**.

---

## Primary Objective

**Protect your economic scaling curve.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Avoid becoming the table’s military target
* Keep losses cheap and replaceable
* Reach late game with intact influence and income

---

## Engagement Rules (Strict)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. You are fighting **defensively** or at a choke
2. You can cap losses cheaply
3. The fight **prevents future attacks** (deterrence or denial)

### Refuse combat if:

* The fight is “even”
* The fight proves strength but gains nothing
* The fight trades ships for pride

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1–2 interceptors**
* Risky but tolerable: **1 cruiser**
* Unacceptable:

  * Multiple cruisers
  * Any dreadnought
  * Multi-round attritional fights

Eridani wins by **not paying compound interest on losses**.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Consolidate fleets defensively
* Pull ships *back*, not forward
* Secure **one** defensible border, not all borders
* Pass earlier to protect influence and economy

If forced to choose:

> Lose space, not tempo.

---

## Tech Priorities (Defensive)

* **Hull** (loss reduction)
* **Computers** (reliable deterrence)
* **Energy efficiency**

Delay:

* Weapon spikes
* Track completions that draw attention
* “Statement” upgrades

Your tech should say: *“Hard to hurt”*, not *“Come test me.”*

---

## Fleet Posture

* Compact defensive fleets
* Fleets visible enough to deter, not intimidate
* No deep strikes
* No pursuit of retreating enemies

Your fleet is a **warning sign**, not a weapon.

---

## Territory Posture

* Defend:

  * Core economic sectors
  * Choke points near your home
* Abandon:

  * Marginal outer tiles
  * Anything that costs more to hold than it’s worth

Eridani should never die defending a tile that doesn’t pay for itself.

---

## Diplomatic Actions (Critical for Eridani)

* Downplay your income (“It looks better than it is”)
* Encourage threats elsewhere
* Accept temporary non-aggression readily
* Avoid finishing tech tracks publicly

You want the table thinking:

> “They’re rich, but not ready.”

---

## Psychological Discipline (Most Players Fail Here)

**DO NOT:**

* Fight to prove dominance
* Retaliate immediately
* Overbuild fleets “just in case”
* Escalate because you can afford it

Eridani loses games by **acting like the villain too early**.

---

## Transition Rule (Very Important)

This defensive posture **ends** when:

* You reach late game (final 2 rounds), **or**
* You can deliver a **single decisive denial strike**, **or**
* Opponents pivot away from you

At that point:

* Shift from defense → conversion
* Economy → points
* Deterrence → lockdown

---

## Success Indicators

You are defending correctly if:

* Attacks against you slow or stop
* Opponents fight each other instead
* Your income continues to grow
* You enter late game without catastrophic losses
