## 1. Faction Identity (Why Eridani Is Dangerous)

Eridani is the **strongest pure economic faction** in Eclipse.

They do not win by:

* clever tricks
* surprise attacks
* tech gimmicks

They win by:

* **outproducing everyone**
* forcing others into inefficient reactions
* turning money into inevitability

If Eridani is allowed to scale uninterrupted, **the game is effectively on a clock**.

---

## 2. Strengths & Structural Weaknesses

### Strengths

* Superior early and midgame income
* Excellent flexibility in spending
* Strong late-game fleet potential
* Forgiving of minor tactical errors

### Weaknesses

* Attracts table attention
* Vulnerable to early disruption
* Can overexpand and implode on influence
* Wins late → must survive midgame pressure

**Key truth:**
Eridani loses when they *look scary too early*.

---

## 3. Core Strategic Principle

> **Eridani’s goal is not domination — it is inevitability.**

You are trying to reach a point where:

* you can afford any tech
* replace fleets instantly
* build points faster than opponents can stop you

Everything you do should serve that curve.

---

## 4. Opening Strategy (Rounds 1–2)

### Primary Goals

1. Secure **high-income core sectors**
2. Expand *just enough* to justify your economy
3. Avoid provoking the table

---

### Exploration Priorities

Top-tier tiles:

* Multiple **money planets**
* Money + science combinations
* Safe Ancient sectors (for later farming)

Avoid:

* Dead tiles unless strategically blocking
* Aggressive forward exploration that signals threat

**You want to look prosperous, not aggressive.**

---

### Influence Discipline

* Claim fewer sectors than you *could*
* Always leave influence buffer
* Never tax early unless unavoidable

> Eridani collapses not from poverty, but from **overreach**.

---

### Early Technology Picks

**Absolute priorities:**

* Economy techs (money first, science second)
* Energy efficiency
* +1 Drive (to leverage future fleets)

**Delay:**

* Weapons
* Expensive hulls
* Niche tech

You don’t need early combat superiority — your money will buy it later.

---

## 5. Early Fleet Doctrine

### What to Build

* Minimal interceptors
* Just enough to:

  * deter opportunistic attacks
  * clear light resistance
  * police borders

### What Not to Build

* Large fleets
* Cruisers too early
* Dreadnoughts before midgame

**Early Eridani ships are placeholders, not investments.**

---

## 6. Midgame Strategy (Rounds 3–5) — The Critical Phase

This is where Eridani **wins or gets dogpiled**.

### Midgame Objectives

1. Convert income → tech advantage
2. Avoid being the clear military leader
3. Prepare for late-game conversion

---

### Technology Strategy (Eridani’s Real Weapon)

Eridani should:

* Buy tech **slightly later**, but **more often**
* Let others reveal priorities
* Counter-tech efficiently

Strong midgame picks:

* Computer upgrades
* Hull upgrades
* Selective weapon upgrades
* Advanced economy techs

Avoid tech races unless:

* you can *finish* a track
* it scores directly

---

### Combat Philosophy

Eridani does not want war.
Eridani wants **decisive, one-sided engagements**.

Fight only when:

* opponent is influence-starved
* opponent just passed
* sector gain is guaranteed
* retaliation is expensive for them

Best Eridani fights:

* punitive strikes
* border corrections
* late-game point denial

Worst Eridani fights:

* attritional wars
* symmetric fleet clashes
* early “statement” battles

---

## 7. Diplomacy & Table Management (Essential Skill)

Eridani must manage perception.

### What You Want the Table to Believe

* “They’re rich, but passive”
* “Someone else is the real threat”
* “We can deal with them later”

### How to Achieve This

* Don’t park massive fleets on borders
* Let aggressive factions fight
* Offer non-aggression early
* Avoid finishing tech tracks publicly

**If the table unites against you, you misplayed earlier rounds.**

---

## 8. Scoring Paths for Eridani

Eridani scores best by **buying points efficiently**, not by specializing.

### Primary Scoring

* Monoliths (excellent conversion)
* Tech tracks (easy to finish late)
* Controlled sectors

### Secondary

* Ambassador tiles
* Selective combat points

**Eridani should score in volume, not in spikes.**

---

## 9. Late Game Strategy (Final 1–2 Rounds)

This is where Eridani becomes terrifying.

### Late Game Priorities

* Convert excess money into:

  * monoliths
  * tech track completions
  * defensive fleets
* Lock down high-value sectors
* Pass early to preserve economy

### Fleet Usage

* Build fleets late and suddenly
* Use them defensively or surgically
* Avoid prolonged endgame wars

> Late-game Eridani fleets exist to **prevent interference**, not conquer the galaxy.

## 10. Matchup Awareness

| Opponent  | Eridani Response                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Terrans   | Outscale, deny safe pivots         |
| Hydran    | Pressure midgame before spike      |
| Orion     | Avoid early conflict, outgrow      |
| Draco     | Minimize combat exposure           |
| Planta    | Mobility + economy beats sprawl    |
| Mechanema | Win on flexibility, not raw output |

---

## 11. Common Eridani Mistakes

* Expanding too fast
* Showing power too early
* Fighting “because you can afford it”
* Ignoring influence pressure
* Waiting too long to convert money into points

---

## 12. Eridani Win Condition (One Sentence)

> **Eridani wins by quietly becoming too rich to stop, then turning that wealth into points faster than the table can respond.**

---
