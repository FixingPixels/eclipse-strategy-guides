Below is a **single, universal Anti-Eridani Empire Defensive Playbook**, usable by **any faction** facing Eridani in **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy**.

This is not about “beating Eridani in combat.”
It is about **breaking inevitability**.

---

## Core Rule (Memorize This)

> **You do not beat Eridani by winning battles.
> You beat Eridani by making time expensive.**

This playbook is sufficient on its own.
Faction-specific tweaks improve execution, but **this** is the doctrine that prevents Eridani from running away with the game.

# ANTI-ERIDANI DEFENSIVE PLAYBOOK

**Name:** *Break the Curve*

## Core Truth (Read This First)

Eridani does not win by fighting.
Eridani wins by **arriving at the late game uncontested**.

If Eridani reaches the final rounds with:

* intact influence
* uninterrupted income
* freedom to convert money into points

…the game is already lost.

Your defense must act **before** that point.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* Eridani has visibly higher income than the table
* Eridani is expanding safely with minimal fleets
* Eridani is being “left alone for now”
* Players say: *“We’ll deal with them later”*

That phrase is the warning siren.

---

## Threat Model

Eridani’s threat is:

* economic snowballing
* late-game flexibility
* loss absorption

Eridani is weakest when:

* forced to react
* required to defend multiple vectors
* pushed into spending money *early* instead of scaling

---

## Primary Objective

**Disrupt Eridani’s growth curve before it hardens.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Force Eridani to spend money on defense
* Increase Eridani’s influence pressure
* Prevent clean late-game conversion

You do **not** need to cripple Eridani.
You need to **delay and tax** them.

---

## Engagement Rules (Critical Discipline)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight forces Eridani to respond again next round
2. The fight threatens a **core economic sector**
3. Losses are asymmetric *against Eridani*

### Avoid fights that:

* Are “even”
* Happen far from Eridani’s economy
* Let Eridani replace losses effortlessly

**The goal is repeated pressure, not decisive victory.**

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: 1–2 interceptors
* Risky: 1 cruiser
* Unacceptable:

  * Multi-round attrition
  * Trading dreadnoughts
  * Deep strikes that cannot be sustained

If Eridani can rebuild faster than you can pressure, disengage and reposition.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Advance toward **Eridani-adjacent sectors**
* Contest expansion paths
* Force Eridani to choose between:

  * defending income
  * expanding further
* Coordinate pressure implicitly with others (even without formal alliance)

Eridani must be made to feel **unsafe spending freely**.

---

## Tech Priorities

* **Mobility** (drive upgrades)
* **Accuracy** (computers)
* **Moderate weapons** (enough to threaten, not overcommit)

Avoid:

* Heavy economic tech (you’re racing time)
* Defensive-only builds
* Late-game-only upgrades

---

## Fleet Posture

* Mobile, forward-leaning fleets
* Positioned to threaten multiple sectors
* Never parked purely defensively

Your fleets exist to **force decisions**, not win battles.

---

## Territory Posture

* Contest border sectors aggressively
* Deny Eridani clean expansion routes
* Accept losing marginal space elsewhere if it maintains pressure on Eridani

Space is currency.
Spend it where it matters.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Frame Eridani as the *future* threat, not the current villain
* Encourage shared pressure without formal coalitions
* Normalize the idea that “Eridani must be slowed now”

Avoid:

* Public dogpiling rhetoric
* Declaring Eridani the enemy too early

You want **pressure**, not martyrdom.

---

## Eridani Traps to Avoid

* Waiting for Eridani to “become scary”
* Trying to out-economy Eridani
* One-time punitive strikes
* Letting Eridani recover quietly after a single hit

If Eridani gets a calm round, you failed.

---

## Success Indicators

You are succeeding if:

* Eridani builds fleets earlier than planned
* Eridani taxes influence sooner than expected
* Eridani delays tech or monolith conversion
* Eridani stops expanding confidently

---

## Exit Condition

Disengage or pivot when **any** are true:

* Eridani’s curve is visibly flattened
* Another faction becomes the immediate win threat
* The game enters final scoring rounds

At that point, shift from pressure → denial.
