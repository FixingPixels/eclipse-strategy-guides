# Protect the Breakpoint
## Hydran Defensive Doctrine (Memorize This)

> **Hydran does not survive by resisting pressure.
> Hydran survives by refusing to fight until resistance is irrelevant.**

---

## Faction Reality (Read First)

Hydran does not defend territory.
Hydran defends **time-to-breakpoint**.

Your advantage is not gradual—it is **discontinuous**.
You are fragile until your chosen tech advantage turns on.
Defense exists to **buy those rounds cleanly**.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* A neighbor applies early or probing pressure
* The table notices your tech acceleration
* You are forced to choose between defense and research
* You feel compelled to “use” your tech early

---

## Threat Model

Hydran is attacked in four common ways:

1. **Early harassment** to delay research
2. **Containment** before tech payoff
3. **Forced fights** to expose fragility
4. **Coalition pressure** due to perceived inevitability

Opponents don’t need to beat you now—they need to **interrupt your timing**.

---

## Primary Objective

**Reach your chosen tech breakpoint intact.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Keep economy just sufficient (not optimal)
* Avoid public tech dominance too early
* Prevent forced, repeatable combat

---

## Engagement Rules (Strict Discipline)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight occurs **after** your tech advantage is active, **or**
2. You fight defensively with **guaranteed loss caps**, **and**
3. The fight removes future pressure (deterrence or denial)

### Refuse combat if:

* You are pre-breakpoint
* The fight is symmetric
* You cannot end the pressure with one engagement

Hydran loses games by **fighting one round too early**.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1 interceptor**
* Risky: **1 cruiser** (only post-breakpoint)
* Unacceptable:

  * Any dreadnought
  * Multi-round attrition
  * Any loss that delays research

If a fight costs you a tech action next round, it was a failure.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Consolidate fleets inward
* Fortify one or two **high-leverage choke points**
* Reduce exposed borders
* Pass earlier to protect influence and science

If forced to choose:

> Lose space, not research tempo.

---

## Tech Priorities (Defensive)

* **Energy efficiency** (keeps designs viable)
* **Hull** (variance reduction)
* **Computers** (deterrent accuracy)

Delay:

* Weapon spikes that reveal intent
* Track completions before payoff
* Redundant tech that dilutes focus

Your tech should say: *“Not yet.”*

---

## Fleet Posture

* Small, elite defensive stacks
* Fleets positioned to punish overreach
* No forward deployments
* No pursuit of retreating enemies

Hydran fleets are **tripwires**, not battering rams.

---

## Territory Posture

* Defend:

  * Science-rich core sectors
  * Sectors that protect your breakpoint timing
* Abandon:

  * Marginal outer tiles
  * Space that increases border count without payoff

Hydran must never die defending a tile that doesn’t protect research.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Downplay tech impact (“It’s not online yet”)
* Encourage aggression elsewhere
* Accept temporary non-aggression readily
* Avoid public tech track completion celebrations

You want the table thinking:

> “They’re close, but not ready.”

---

## Psychological Discipline (Most Critical)

**DO NOT:**

* Use tech as soon as you unlock it
* Fight to demonstrate superiority
* Split tech paths defensively
* Overbuild fleets “to be safe”

Hydran defense fails when **ego outruns timing**.

---

## Transition Rule (The Moment That Matters)

This defensive posture **ends immediately** when:

* Your tech breakpoint is active **and**
* You can win a fight **decisively and cleanly**

At that moment:

* Shift from denial → enforcement
* From concealment → leverage
* From defense → selective aggression

Do not linger in defense once your advantage exists.

---

## Success Indicators

You are defending correctly if:

* Your research cadence remains uninterrupted
* Opponents hesitate to engage
* You reach your breakpoint without major losses
* Pressure dissipates or becomes cautious
