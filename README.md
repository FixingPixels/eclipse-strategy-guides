## Faction Guides

### Terran Federation

**Playstyle:** Adaptable · Diplomatic · Late-Game Scaling

The most flexible faction in Eclipse. Terrans don't spike in any category but remain relevant in every phase. They win by surviving the early game without overcommitting, controlling the midgame through adaptation, and quietly outscoring everyone at the end.

**Key Strengths:** Balanced economy, excellent recovery, multiple scoring paths  
**Key Weaknesses:** No automatic win condition, can fall behind if passive

- [Defensive Playbook](Terran%20Federation/Terran%20Federation%20Defensive%20Playbook.md)

### Eridani Empire

**Playstyle:** Economic · Scaling · Inevitable

The strongest pure economic faction. Eridani doesn't win through tricks or aggression—they win by outproducing everyone and turning money into inevitability. If allowed to scale uninterrupted, the game is effectively on a clock.

**Key Strengths:** Superior income, spending flexibility, strong late-game fleet potential  
**Key Weaknesses:** Attracts table attention, vulnerable to early disruption

### Hydran Progress

**Playstyle:** Technology · Asymmetric · Precision

The premier technology faction. Hydran wins by reaching tech thresholds earlier than anyone else and forcing opponents to fight on Hydran-defined terms. They're strongest when the table realizes—too late—that the rules of engagement have changed.

**Key Strengths:** Fastest advanced tech access, early ship specialization, counter-tech potential  
**Key Weaknesses:** Fragile early economy, vulnerable to early pressure, poor timing is punished hard

- [Defensive Playbook](Hydran%20Progress/Hydran%20Progress%20Defensive%20Playbook.md)
- [Anti-Hydran Playbook](Hydran%20Progress/Anti-Hydran%20Progress%20Defensive%20Playbooks.md)

---

### Orion Hegemony

**Playstyle:** Aggressive · Early-Game · Coercive

Built for early military dominance. Orion's window is early-to-midgame—miss it, and the edge evaporates. They win by dictating the early map, extracting concessions without full wars, and converting fear into position and points.

**Key Strengths:** Superior early combat, strong intimidation, denies optimal expansion  
**Key Weaknesses:** Weak late-game scaling, combat losses hurt, attracts table attention

- [Player Strategy Guide](Orion%20Hegemony/Orion%20Hegemony%20Player%20Strategy%20%20Guide.md)
- [Defensive Playbook](Orion%20Hegemony/Orion%20Hegemony%20Defensive%20Playbook.md)
- [Anti-Orion Playbook](Orion%20Hegemony/Anti-Orion%20Hegemony%20Defensive%20Playbook.md)

---

### Draco Ascendancy

**Playstyle:** Combat-Extractive · Opportunistic · Midgame

A combat-extractive faction that doesn't win by dominating—it wins by profiting. Draco thrives when the galaxy bleeds, choosing fights others can't afford and converting destruction into advantage. They need the galaxy to be unstable.

**Key Strengths:** Gains value from combat, efficient point generation through fighting, strong midgame leverage  
**Key Weaknesses:** Dependent on conflict, vulnerable in peaceful games, requires strong timing

📁 **Guides:**
- [Player Strategy Guide](Draco%20Ascendancy/Draco%20Ascendancy%20Player%20Strategy%20%20Guide.md)
- [Defensive Playbook](Draco%20Ascendancy/Draco%20Ascendancy%20Defensive%20Playbook.md)
- [Anti-Draco Playbook](Draco%20Ascendancy/Anti-Draco%20Defensive%20Playbooks.md)

---

### Planta

**Playstyle:** Territorial · Defensive · Passive Scoring

A territorial control faction that wins by claiming and holding more space than anyone else. Planta turns the galaxy into a maze that only they can navigate efficiently. They don't need to be scary—they need to be *everywhere*.

**Key Strengths:** Extremely efficient influence, wider expansion than any faction, strong defensive posture  
**Key Weaknesses:** Slower tech progression, mediocre fleet quality, stagnates if boxed early

📁 **Guides:**
- [Player Strategy Guide](Planta/Planta%20Player%20Strategy%20%20Guide.md)
- [Defensive Playbook](Planta/Planta%20Defensive%20Playbook.md)
- [Anti-Planta Playbook](Planta/Anti-Planta%20Defensive%20Playbooks.md)

---

### Mechanema

**Playstyle:** Efficient · Attrition · Persistent

An efficiency engine that wins by making conflict affordable for itself and expensive for everyone else. Mechanema doesn't spike—it endures. They're comfortable fighting more often than others because they can replace losses faster.

**Key Strengths:** Extremely efficient ship production, strong midgame military presence, excellent at attrition  
**Key Weaknesses:** Limited flexibility, predictable strategy, struggles against extreme tech asymmetry

📁 **Guides:**
- [Player Strategy Guide](Mechanema/Mechanema%20Player%20Strategy%20%20Guide.md)
