Below is a **comprehensive, faction-specific defensive playbook for Orion Hegemony**, written for players who **choose Orion** and need to survive pressure **without wasting their early advantage or collapsing late**.

Applies to **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy** (and *Second Dawn*).

# Convert Fear into Stability


## Orion Defensive Doctrine (Memorize This)

> **Orion does not defend by staying angry.
> Orion defends by knowing when fear has already done its job.**

## Faction Reality (Read First)

Orion does not defend by turtling.
Orion defends by **ending threats quickly and then disengaging**.

Your strength is **early coercion**, not endurance.
Defense exists to:

* protect what you already took
* prevent containment
* buy time to pivot out of aggression

If you keep fighting defensively forever, you lose.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* Early aggression has drawn table attention
* Neighbors begin reinforcing borders against you
* A coalition or “contain Orion” sentiment emerges
* You are past the early game and still being treated as the threat

---

## Threat Model

Orion is attacked in three main ways:

1. **Containment** after early intimidation
2. **Attritional pressure** meant to exhaust your fleets
3. **Late-game outscaling** while you stay militarized

Opponents are trying to:

> Survive you, then outgrow you.

---

## Primary Objective

**Lock in early gains and prevent containment.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Reduce combat frequency
* Preserve fleet credibility
* Transition toward scoring and defense

Orion defense is about **closing the window cleanly**, not keeping it open.

---

## Engagement Rules (Very Important)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight **secures or preserves a key sector**
2. The fight is **decisive and short**
3. The fight **reduces future pressure**

### Refuse combat if:

* The fight is symmetric
* The fight is attritional
* The fight exists “to show strength”

Orion loses when it proves strength repeatedly instead of **using it once**.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1–2 interceptors**
* Risky: **1 cruiser**
* Unacceptable:

  * Multiple cruisers
  * Any dreadnought
  * Multi-round attrition

If a loss weakens your intimidation posture, it’s too much.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Pull fleets back to **defensible, valuable sectors**
* Consolidate forces (no thin borders)
* Stop forward expansion
* Pass earlier to protect influence and economy

If forced to choose:

> Defend position, not reputation.

---

## Tech Priorities (Defensive)

* **Hull** (variance reduction)
* **Computers** (reliable deterrence)
* **Energy efficiency**

Delay:

* New weapon spikes
* Over-engineering ships
* Track races that don’t score immediately

Your tech should say: *“Still dangerous”*, not *“Still attacking.”*

---

## Fleet Posture

* Compact, intimidating defensive stacks
* Positioned at choke points and high-value sectors
* No deep strikes
* No pursuit of retreating enemies

Your fleets exist to **discourage**, not dominate.

---

## Territory Posture

* Defend:

  * Early-won forward sectors
  * Choke points that shape the map
* Abandon:

  * Marginal space taken only to threaten
  * Tiles that stretch your borders unnecessarily

Orion should never bleed defending space that doesn’t justify its cost.

---

## Diplomatic Actions (Critical for Orion)

* De-escalate publicly (“mission accomplished” framing)
* Encourage others to fight elsewhere
* Accept non-aggression readily
* Avoid antagonistic language

You want the table thinking:

> “They already did their damage. Someone else is the problem now.”

---

## Psychological Discipline (Where Orion Players Fail)

**DO NOT:**

* Keep attacking to stay relevant
* Fight to maintain fear
* Overbuild fleets “because we’re Orion”
* Take containment personally

Orion defense fails when **ego replaces timing**.

---

## Transition Rule (The Pivot)

This defensive posture ends when:

* Your borders stabilize, **or**
* The table’s attention shifts, **or**
* The game enters late scoring rounds

At that point:

* Shift from intimidation → denial
* From aggression → point conversion
* From fleet growth → fleet preservation

If you don’t pivot, you get outscaled.

---

## Success Indicators

You are defending correctly if:

* Attacks against you slow or stop
* Neighbors fortify instead of advancing
* You retain early gains into mid/late game
* You are no longer the table’s focal threat
