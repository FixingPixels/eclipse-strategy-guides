## 1. Faction Identity (Why Orion Is Feared)

Orion is built for **early military dominance**.

They do not win by:

* late-game economy
* tech races
* passive scoring

They win by:

* **dictating the early map**
* extracting concessions without full wars
* converting fear into position and points

**Orion’s window is early-to-midgame.** Miss it, and your edge evaporates.

---

## 2. Strengths & Structural Weaknesses

### Strengths

* Superior early combat capability
* Strong intimidation value
* Excellent at denying opponents optimal expansion
* Can force early diplomatic outcomes

### Weaknesses

* Weak late-game scaling
* Combat losses hurt more than they appear
* Table attention magnet
* Falls behind if early pressure stalls

**Key truth:**
Orion doesn’t win fights to destroy—**it wins fights to shape the board**.

---

## 3. Core Strategic Principle

> **Orion must turn early military advantage into permanent advantages before others stabilize.**

Permanent advantages include:

* prime sectors
* choke points
* weakened neighbors
* forced treaties

Kills alone don’t win you the game.

---

## 4. Opening Strategy (Rounds 1–2)

### Primary Goals

1. Establish **credible early threat**
2. Deny opponents optimal expansion paths
3. Secure forward, valuable sectors

---

### Exploration Priorities

Top-tier tiles:

* High-value tiles near opponents
* Tiles that block or funnel expansion
* Any sector that forces a reaction

Lower priority:

* Safe interior tiles
* Long-term economic setups

**You are racing the clock, not building a home.**

---

### Influence & Expansion

* Expand assertively but not recklessly
* Claim forward sectors early
* Keep a small influence buffer—combat costs actions

Orion can tolerate tighter influence early *if* it yields positional control.

---

### Early Technology Picks

**High priorities:**

* Weapons
* Computers (accuracy matters)
* Hull upgrades

**Lower priority:**

* Deep economy tech
* Late-game scaling tech
* Excessive science investment

You need **functional superiority now**, not theoretical power later.

---

## 5. Early Fleet Doctrine

### What to Build

* Interceptors immediately
* Early cruisers if resources allow
* Aggressive but efficient designs

### Ship Design Priorities

* Accuracy > raw damage
* Enough hull to survive one bad roll
* Minimal waste

### What Not to Build

* Dreadnoughts too early
* Over-engineered ships
* Fleets you can’t afford to lose

Your fleet is leverage—**don’t overpay for leverage**.

---

## 6. Midgame Strategy (Rounds 3–5) — Convert or Die

This phase determines whether Orion wins or fades.

### Midgame Objectives

1. Lock in territorial advantage
2. Force weaker neighbors into defensive play
3. Transition from intimidation to scoring

---

### Combat Philosophy

Orion fights **often**, but not blindly.

Fight when:

* opponent is still developing
* you can gain or lock a sector
* you can extract concessions

Avoid:

* even trades
* prolonged wars
* chasing enemies into depth

Every Orion fight should **change the board state**.

---

### Diplomacy (Critical Skill)

Orion diplomacy is coercive.

### What You Want the Table to Think

* “We should give them space”
* “They’ll hurt someone else first”
* “Let’s survive and deal with them later”

### How to Use Diplomacy

* Threaten without committing
* Accept non-aggression that benefits you
* Redirect aggression elsewhere

If the table unites early against you, you misplayed your posture.

---

## 7. Transitioning to the Late Game (The Hard Part)

Orion **must pivot** or it loses.

### Necessary Transitions

* Reduce combat frequency
* Shift to point conversion
* Fortify rather than expand

Common Orion failure:

> Continuing early aggression when the advantage is gone.

You are not the strongest anymore—**act accordingly**.

---

## 8. Scoring Paths for Orion

Orion scores through **early denial + midgame consolidation**.

### Primary Scoring

* Controlled sectors (especially forward ones)
* Combat points (early to midgame)
* Ambassador tiles

### Secondary

* Selective tech tracks
* Late monoliths (if economy survives)

Orion rarely wins on tech alone.

---

## 9. Late Game Strategy (Final 1–2 Rounds)

### Late Game Priorities

* Hold what you took
* Prevent others from scoring efficiently
* Avoid unnecessary fights

### Fleet Usage

* Defensive fleets
* Border deterrence
* Minimal deep strikes

Late-game Orion wins by **making attacks too costly**.

---

## 10. Matchup Awareness

| Opponent  | Orion Response            |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Terrans   | Pressure before pivot     |
| Eridani   | Harass early economy      |
| Hydran    | Force early fights        |
| Planta    | Break choke points early  |
| Mechanema | Strike before mass builds |
| Draco     | Avoid feeding them        |

---

## 11. Common Orion Mistakes

* Fighting for pride instead of position
* Overbuilding fleets
* Ignoring economy entirely
* Becoming the table’s early villain
* Failing to pivot midgame

---

## 12. Orion Win Condition (One Sentence)

> **Orion wins by reshaping the early galaxy so thoroughly that opponents never recover their optimal paths.**

---
