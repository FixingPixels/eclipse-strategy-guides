Below is a **single, universal Anti-Orion Hegemony Defensive Playbook**, usable by **any faction** facing Orion in **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy**.

This doctrine is about **surviving the burst** and **forcing the pivot Orion doesn’t want**.

# Absorb the Shock
## Core Rule (Memorize This)

> **You do not beat Orion by fighting harder.
> You beat Orion by making early violence fail to matter.**

This playbook is sufficient on its own.
Faction-specific tweaks improve execution—but **this** doctrine prevents Orion from converting fear into victory.
## Core Truth (Read First)

Orion wins by **early coercion and tempo**.
If Orion converts fear into permanent position, you lose.
If Orion is forced into **attrition or delay**, its advantage evaporates.

Your job is not to beat Orion early.
Your job is to **deny conversion**.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* Orion fields early cruisers or aggressive interceptors
* Orion expands forward toward multiple players
* You feel pressure to respond immediately
* The table says: *“We have to deal with Orion now”*

That reaction is what Orion wants.

---

## Threat Model

Orion’s threat is:

* early military superiority
* intimidation-driven expansion
* opponents overreacting

Orion is weakest when:

* fights do not change the map
* early losses don’t yield territory
* the game slows into midgame economics

---

## Primary Objective

**Deny Orion permanent gains from early aggression.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Preserve your economy and influence
* Force Orion into overcommitment
* Extend the game past Orion’s optimal window

You are not racing Orion—you are **outlasting the burst**.

---

## Engagement Rules (Critical Discipline)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight is **defensive or positional**
2. You can cap losses cheaply
3. The fight **blocks Orion’s expansion or locks a choke**

### Refuse combat if:

* The fight is forward or pride-driven
* The fight is symmetric
* The fight doesn’t deny territory

If Orion attacks and gains nothing, **you win the exchange**.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1 interceptor**
* Risky: **1 cruiser** (only to save a key sector)
* Unacceptable:

  * Multi-round attrition
  * Capital ship losses
  * Trading losses for intimidation

If you bleed to “prove resistance,” Orion succeeded.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Consolidate fleets defensively
* Fortify choke points near your core
* Delay retaliation
* Pass earlier to protect influence and economy

If forced to choose:

> Lose tempo battles, not territory battles.

---

## Tech Priorities

* **Hull** (variance reduction)
* **Computers** (reliable deterrence)
* **Energy efficiency**

Avoid:

* Weapon races
* Flashy upgrades
* Over-investing in early fleet tech

Your tech should say: *“Hard to push through.”*

---

## Fleet Posture

* Compact defensive stacks
* Positioned to block movement
* No pursuit of retreating Orion fleets
* No forward deployment

Your fleet exists to **deny expansion**, not chase Orion.

---

## Territory Posture

* Defend:

  * Core sectors
  * Choke points Orion must pass
* Abandon:

  * Marginal forward tiles
  * Space taken only to signal strength

Space only matters if it limits Orion’s options.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Normalize patience (“let them burn out”)
* Encourage others to **hold**, not attack
* Avoid framing Orion as an existential threat
* Let Orion feel successful *without* real gains

You want the table thinking:

> “They’re scary, but not winning.”

---

## Orion Traps to Avoid

* Immediate retaliation
* “We have to stop them now” panic
* Chasing early fleets
* Turning probes into wars
* Letting Orion dictate tempo

If Orion controls the pace, you already lost ground.

---

## Success Indicators

You are succeeding if:

* Orion stops expanding aggressively
* Orion builds defensively
* Orion’s early fleets idle or retreat
* The game transitions to midgame economics intact

---

## Exit Condition

Pivot away from this posture when **any** are true:

* Orion’s early window clearly closes
* Orion begins scaling instead of attacking
* Another faction becomes the immediate win threat

At that point, shift from **absorption → normal play**.
