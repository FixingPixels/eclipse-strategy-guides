## 1. Faction Identity (Why Terrans Are Strong)

Terrans are the **most flexible faction in Eclipse**.

They are not:

* the fastest
* the richest
* the most violent
* the most advanced

They *are*:

* resilient
* adaptable
* excellent at midgame pivots
* hard to punish for small mistakes

**Terrans win by staying relevant in every phase of the game.**

---

## 2. Terran Strengths & Weaknesses

### Strengths

* Balanced starting economy
* No crippling constraints
* Excellent recovery from setbacks
* Strong late-game adaptability
* Easy access to multiple scoring paths

### Weaknesses

* No automatic win condition
* Can fall behind if played passively
* Require good timing judgment
* Lose races against specialized factions

**Key truth:**
Terrans are only weak if *you hesitate too long*.

---

## 3. Opening Strategy (Rounds 1–2)

### Primary Goals

1. Establish a **stable 3–4 sector core**
2. Improve economy **before** fleet
3. Stay diplomatically non-threatening

### Exploration

* **Prioritize tiles with**:
  * multiple planets
  * money + science
* **Avoid**:
  * dead tiles unless they block opponents
  * early Ancients unless you’re set up to farm them later

**Terrans do not need risky early fights.**

---

### Influence & Expansion

* Expand conservatively
* Keep **2–3 influence in reserve** at all times
* Never expand just because you “can”

> If your influence track feels tight early, you expanded too fast.

---

### Technology (Early Picks)

Strong early options:

* Economy upgrades (money/science)
* +1 Drive (mobility = flexibility)
* Hull or Computer upgrades

Avoid early:

* Heavy weapons
* Expensive ship designs
* Niche tech that locks you into a plan

---

## 4. Early Fleet Doctrine

### What You Want

* 1–2 interceptors
* Cheap, mobile, deterrent-focused

### What You Don’t Want

* Fleet bloat
* “Showpiece” ships
* Early dreadnoughts

**Your ships early are political tools, not war machines.**

---

## 5. Midgame Strategy (Rounds 3–5) — Where Terrans Shine

This is where Terrans win or lose.

### Midgame Objectives

1. Identify the **table leader**
2. Choose a **scoring direction**
3. Build *just enough* military credibility

---

### Technology Pivot (Critical)

Terrans should **pivot based on board state**, not pre-plan.

Examples:

* If neighbors are aggressive → defensive tech + starbases
* If table is passive → economy + points tech
* If tech race is happening → targeted counters, not chasing

**Terrans win by counter-teching, not racing.**

---

### Combat Posture

* Avoid symmetric fights
* Strike when:

  * opponent just passed
  * opponent is influence-poor
  * you can take a sector cheaply

Best Terran combats:

* Punitive
* Surgical
* Opportunistic

Worst Terran combats:

* Prolonged wars
* Ego fights
* “Testing builds”

---

## 6. Diplomacy (Terran Superpower)

Terrans are excellent diplomats because:

* They don’t scare people early
* They can credibly pivot to violence later

### How to Use Diplomacy

* Let aggressive factions exhaust each other
* Offer non-aggression when it benefits *you*
* Encourage fights elsewhere

**You want to look helpful, not dominant.**

---

## 7. Scoring Paths for Terrans

Terrans can win via **multiple overlapping scoring routes**.

### Reliable Paths

* Controlled sectors
* Technology tracks
* Ambassador tiles
* Monoliths

### Less Reliable

* Combat-heavy victory
* Ancient farming as sole plan

**Terrans should score in at least 3 categories.**

---

## 8. Late Game Strategy (Final 1–2 Rounds)

### Shift Mentality

* Stop expanding
* Stop “improving”
* Start **converting resources to points**

### Best Late-Game Moves

* Monolith spam
* Locking safe sectors
* Defensive fleets that discourage attacks
* Passing early to lock economy

### Common Losing Mistake

> “I can squeeze one more action.”

That action usually costs you:

* influence
* economy
* final scoring position

## 9. What Terrans Must Watch For (Threat Matrix)

| Opponent  | What to Do                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Eridani   | Slow them diplomatically, deny prime tiles |
| Hydran    | Pressure midgame before tech spike         |
| Orion     | Avoid early conflict, counter later        |
| Draco     | Don’t feed them fights                     |
| Planta    | Tech mobility, avoid being boxed           |
| Mechanema | Outmaneuver, don’t outproduce              |

---

## 10. Terran Win Condition (In One Sentence)

> **Terrans win by surviving the early game without committing, controlling the midgame through flexibility, and quietly outscoring everyone at the end.**

---
