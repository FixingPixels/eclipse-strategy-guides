Below is a **comprehensive, faction-specific defensive playbook for the Terran Federation**, written for players who **choose Terrans** and want to absorb pressure **without losing flexibility or falling behind on points**.

Applies to **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy** (and *Second Dawn*).

# Hold the Center

## Terran Defensive Doctrine (Memorize This)

> **Terrans do not defend by standing firm.
> Terrans defend by staying undecided until the right answer is obvious.**

## Faction Reality (Read First)

Terrans do not defend by overpowering threats.
Terrans defend by **remaining adaptable longer than anyone else**.

Your strength is not a spike—it is **option preservation**.
Defense exists to:

* keep multiple paths to victory open
* avoid committing too early
* survive pressure without revealing intent

If you lock yourself into a defensive identity, you lose Terran’s greatest advantage.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* A neighbor begins probing or posturing aggressively
* You are caught between two potential threats
* The table is volatile and alliances are unclear
* You feel pressure to “pick a side” too early

Terran defense starts when **uncertainty increases**, not just when ships appear.

---

## Threat Model

Terrans are pressured in four common ways:

1. **Early intimidation** (Orion-style)
2. **Economic containment** (Eridani-style)
3. **Tech asymmetry threats** (Hydran-style)
4. **Spatial pressure** (Planta-style)

Your enemies want you to **commit early** so they can counter you cleanly.

---

## Primary Objective

**Preserve flexibility while preventing decisive losses.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Keep borders defensible but non-provocative
* Avoid being the table’s “obvious” target
* Maintain influence and economy stability

Terran defense is about **buying clarity**, not winning standoffs.

---

## Engagement Rules (Terran Discipline)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight is **defensive or positional**
2. The outcome preserves or improves future options
3. Losses are capped and acceptable

### Refuse combat if:

* The fight forces specialization
* The fight commits you to a long-term rivalry
* The fight reveals your endgame direction

Terrans lose when they fight **before knowing why**.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1–2 interceptors**
* Risky: **1 cruiser**
* Unacceptable:

  * Capital ship losses
  * Multi-round attrition
  * Any loss that forces emergency tech or builds

If a fight reduces your future choices, it was too costly.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Consolidate fleets into **defensive, central positions**
* Fortify choke points that protect multiple sectors
* Avoid expanding borders during pressure
* Pass earlier to protect influence and economy

If forced to choose:

> Lose marginal space, not strategic ambiguity.

---

## Tech Priorities (Defensive)

* **Hull** (variance reduction)
* **Computers** (reliable deterrence)
* **Energy efficiency**

Delay:

* Weapon spikes
* Full tech-track commitments
* Niche upgrades that signal intent

Your tech should say: *“Prepared for anything.”*

---

## Fleet Posture

* Medium-sized, flexible fleets
* Positioned to respond to multiple threats
* No deep strikes
* No pursuit of retreating enemies

Terran fleets exist to **keep doors open**, not kick them in.

---

## Territory Posture

* Defend:

  * Core sectors
  * Tiles that anchor multiple routes
* Abandon:

  * Long, thin extensions
  * Space that increases border count unnecessarily

Terrans should never defend territory that **forces a decision**.

---

## Diplomatic Actions (Terran Strength)

* Remain non-committal publicly
* Encourage threats to balance each other
* Accept non-aggression readily
* Avoid being the loudest voice at the table

You want the table thinking:

> “They’re solid, but not the problem.”

---

## Psychological Discipline (Where Terran Players Fail)

**DO NOT:**

* Pick a permanent enemy too early
* Overreact to intimidation
* Build fleets “just in case”
* Lock into a single defensive narrative

Terrans lose when **clarity comes before necessity**.

---

## Transition Rule (The Pivot Advantage)

This defensive posture ends when:

* A clear win path emerges, **or**
* A rival overcommits visibly, **or**
* The game enters late scoring rounds

At that moment:

* Shift from flexibility → commitment
* From defense → selective denial
* From posture → conversion

Terrans win by pivoting **later than everyone else**.

---

## Success Indicators

You are defending correctly if:

* Pressure against you dissipates or diffuses
* You retain multiple viable scoring paths
* Your economy and influence remain smooth
* You enter midgame without a forced identity
