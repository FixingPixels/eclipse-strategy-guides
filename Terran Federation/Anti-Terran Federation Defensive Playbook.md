Below is a **single, universal Anti-Terran Federation Defensive Playbook**, usable by **any faction** facing Terrans in **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy**.

This doctrine is about **forcing commitment**. You are not trying to outfight Terrans—you are trying to **remove their flexibility**, because flexibility *is* their defense.

# Force the Choice

## Core Rule (Memorize This)

> **You do not beat Terrans by overpowering them.
> You beat Terrans by making flexibility impossible.**

This playbook is sufficient on its own.
Faction-specific tweaks can improve execution—but **this** doctrine prevents Terrans from winning by quiet adaptability.

## Core Truth (Read First)

Terrans win by **staying undecided longer than everyone else**.
If Terrans keep multiple options open into the mid–late game, they will pivot cleanly and outscore you.

Your defense must **collapse their option space**.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* Terrans are playing quietly but solidly
* Terrans are diplomatically neutral with everyone
* Terrans are “fine no matter what happens”
* You hear: *“They can pivot later”*

That sentence means you’re already late.

---

## Threat Model

Terrans threaten you through:

* adaptability
* counter-teching
* late-game scoring pivots
* opportunistic, low-risk fights

Terrans are weakest when:

* forced to declare priorities early
* pressured on **two incompatible axes**
* denied clean, flexible responses

---

## Primary Objective

**Force Terrans to commit to a single path early.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Increase Terran influence pressure
* Make neutrality expensive
* Deny clean pivot opportunities

You do **not** need to defeat Terrans.
You need to make them **choose—and live with it**.

---

## Engagement Rules (Critical Discipline)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight forces Terrans to **respond again next round**
2. The fight threatens **different priorities simultaneously**
3. The fight removes a safe, low-commitment option

### Avoid fights that:

* Are isolated or symbolic
* Let Terrans counter cheaply
* Reinforce Terran’s “I’ll wait and see” posture

If Terrans can disengage and still feel flexible, you failed.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1–2 interceptors**
* Risky: **1 cruiser** (only if it forces commitment)
* Unacceptable:

  * Multi-round attrition
  * Capital ship trades
  * Fights that don’t narrow Terran options

Losses are acceptable only if **Terran choice-space shrinks**.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Apply pressure to **two different Terran borders**
* Contest **both** economy and mobility routes
* Force Terrans to choose between:

  * tech vs fleets
  * diplomacy vs posture
  * expansion vs consolidation

Terrans hate binary decisions—**create them**.

---

## Tech Priorities

* **Mobility** (to threaten multiple fronts)
* **Accuracy** (to punish “good enough” fleets)
* **Focused weapons** (to create decisive outcomes)

Avoid:

* Defensive tech races
* Long-term economy investments
* Symmetric builds Terrans can mirror

You are buying **clarity**, not endurance.

---

## Fleet Posture

* Mobile, flexible strike forces
* Positioned to threaten **different types of loss**
* Willing to disengage and re-apply pressure elsewhere

Your fleet exists to **force planning errors**, not grind.

---

## Territory Posture

* Contest:

  * Central Terran anchor sectors
  * Tiles that enable safe pivoting
* Ignore:

  * Marginal space Terrans can abandon freely

Space matters only if it **removes future options**.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Frame Terrans as the *quiet long-term threat*
* Normalize early pressure (“they’re too comfortable”)
* Avoid dramatic accusations or coalitions

You want **pressure**, not martyrdom.

---

## Terran Traps to Avoid

* Waiting for Terrans to “declare”
* Forcing a single front of pressure
* Fighting where Terrans are strongest
* Accepting neutral outcomes
* Letting Terrans play mediator

If Terrans are still neutral, you haven’t applied enough pressure.

---

## Success Indicators

You are succeeding if:

* Terrans build fleets earlier than planned
* Terrans finish tech tracks prematurely
* Terrans abandon diplomacy neutrality
* Terrans visibly lock into one strategy

Once Terrans commit, they become manageable.

---

## Exit Condition

Pivot away from this posture when **any** are true:

* Terrans are clearly locked into a path
* Another faction becomes the immediate win threat
* The game enters final scoring rounds

At that point, shift from **forcing choices → exploiting them**.
