## 1. Faction Identity (Why Planta Is Dangerous)

Planta is a **territorial control faction**.

They do not win by:

* tech dominance
* economic explosions
* fleet superiority

They win by:

* **claiming and holding more space than anyone else**
* forcing opponents into inefficient movement and combat
* converting *map control* into steady points

Planta turns the galaxy into a maze that only they can navigate efficiently.

---

## 2. Strengths & Structural Weaknesses

### Strengths

* Extremely efficient use of influence
* Ability to expand wider than any other faction
* Strong defensive posture
* Excellent passive scoring potential

### Weaknesses

* Slower tech progression
* Mediocre fleet quality
* Vulnerable to being outmaneuvered
* Can stagnate if boxed in early

**Key truth:**
Planta doesn’t need to be scary — it needs to be *everywhere*.

---

## 3. Core Strategic Principle

> **Planta wins by making space expensive for everyone else.**

Every extra hex you control:

* taxes opponent movement
* restricts expansion paths
* limits safe targets

You are not racing anyone — you are **constricting them**.

---

## 4. Opening Strategy (Rounds 1–2)

### Primary Goals

1. Claim **more sectors than anyone else**
2. Establish wide borders early
3. Avoid early wars

---

### Exploration Priorities

Top-tier tiles:

* Any tile with planets (even mediocre ones)
* Tiles that block or funnel opponents
* Safe interior expansion routes

Lower priority:

* High-value but isolated tiles
* Risky forward tiles that invite attack

**For Planta, quantity of space > quality of space.**

---

### Influence & Expansion

* Expand aggressively but deliberately
* Use influence advantage to:

  * out-claim neighbors
  * secure choke points
* Maintain just enough buffer to avoid taxation

> Planta’s early advantage is spatial, not economic.

---

### Early Technology Picks

**High priorities:**

* Economy techs (money first)
* Drive upgrades (to reinforce wide borders)
* Defensive tech (hull, shields)

**Lower priority:**

* Weapons
* Expensive specialty tech
* Early tech-track races

Planta’s tech exists to **support territory**, not dominate combat.

---

## 5. Early Fleet Doctrine

### What to Build

* Small interceptor groups
* Defensive placements
* Border patrols

### What Not to Build

* Large roaming fleets
* Early cruisers or dreadnoughts
* Aggressive forward forces

Your ships exist to **discourage movement**, not chase enemies.

---

## 6. Midgame Strategy (Rounds 3–5) — The Lockdown Phase

This is where Planta becomes frustrating to play against.

### Midgame Objectives

1. Solidify borders
2. Force opponents into bad choices
3. Accumulate passive points

---

### Territory Management

* Build starbases in key choke points
* Use fleet placement to:

  * threaten retaliation
  * block movement
* Encourage conflicts *away* from your borders

Planta should look annoying, not threatening.

---

### Combat Philosophy

Planta fights defensively and selectively.

Fight when:

* opponent must move through you
* you can fight on favorable terrain
* the loss hurts them more than you

Avoid:

* deep offensive pushes
* fleet chases
* wars of attrition

Planta wins by **denial**, not destruction.

---

## 7. Diplomacy & Table Presence

Planta diplomacy is positional.

### What You Want the Table to Think

* “They’re big, but slow”
* “We can deal with them later”
* “They’re not the main threat”

### How to Achieve This

* Avoid early aggression
* Let others fight
* Present your expansion as “natural growth”

**Planta thrives when ignored.**

---

## 8. Scoring Paths for Planta

Planta scores through **inevitability**, not bursts.

### Primary Scoring

* Controlled sectors (huge)
* Ambassador tiles
* Monoliths (excellent late conversion)

### Secondary

* Selective combat points
* Modest tech-track scoring

Planta should score **consistently**, not explosively.

---

## 9. Late Game Strategy (Final 1–2 Rounds)

### Late Game Priorities

* Lock borders
* Convert economy to points
* Discourage last-minute attacks

### Fleet Usage

* Defensive fleets
* Starbase-backed positions
* Minimal offensive movement

Planta wants opponents to look at the board and say:

> “It’s not worth it.”

---

## 10. Matchup Awareness

| Opponent  | Planta Response                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Terrans   | Out-expand, deny safe growth     |
| Eridani   | Box them early                   |
| Hydran    | Force movement taxes             |
| Orion     | Absorb early pressure, then wall |
| Draco     | Avoid feeding them fights        |
| Mechanema | Outmaneuver and block            |

---

## 11. Common Planta Mistakes

* Expanding without securing borders
* Ignoring mobility tech
* Letting tech lag too far behind
* Overbuilding fleets
* Picking fights that don’t change the map

---

## 12. Planta Win Condition (One Sentence)

> **Planta wins by quietly owning so much of the galaxy that everyone else runs out of good options.**

---
