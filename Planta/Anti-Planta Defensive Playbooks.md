Below is a **single, universal Anti-Planta Defensive Playbook**, usable by **any faction** facing Planta in **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy**.

This doctrine is about **breaking spatial control**. You are not trying to outfight Planta—you are trying to **invalidate their map advantage**.

# Break the Choke
## Core Rule (Memorize This)

> **You do not beat Planta by pushing harder.
> You beat Planta by making space behave normally again.**

This playbook is sufficient on its own.
Faction-specific tweaks improve execution—but **this** doctrine prevents Planta from winning by geometry alone.

## Core Truth (Read First)

Planta does not win battles.
Planta wins by **making movement expensive** and forcing everyone else to fight on bad terms.

If Planta controls the lanes, they control the game.
Your defense must **restore freedom of movement**, even briefly.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* Planta has expanded wider than the table
* Choke points are fortified or implied
* You are being funneled into bad routes
* Attacking Planta feels “annoying” or “not worth it”

That feeling means Planta is winning.

---

## Threat Model

Planta’s threat is:

* spatial denial
* border friction
* passive point accumulation

Planta is weakest when:

* forced to defend **multiple lanes**
* required to **reposition fleets**
* unable to predict where pressure will appear

---

## Primary Objective

**Disrupt Planta’s choke-point control.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Increase Planta’s border count
* Force fleet relocation
* Create uncertainty in Planta’s movement denial

You do not need to conquer Planta.
You need to **puncture the net**.

---

## Engagement Rules (Critical Discipline)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight **opens or threatens a lane**
2. The fight occurs at or near a choke point
3. The outcome changes future movement options

### Avoid fights that:

* Occur deep inside Planta territory
* Trade ships without positional gain
* Leave choke points intact

If a fight doesn’t change the map, it helps Planta.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1–2 interceptors**
* Risky: **1 cruiser** (only to break a choke)
* Unacceptable:

  * Multi-round attrition
  * Capital ship losses
  * Trading losses for “pressure” alone

Losses are acceptable only if **mobility is gained**.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Identify **2–3 key lanes** Planta relies on
* Apply pressure to **more than one lane**
* Threaten repositioning costs
* Delay engagement until Planta must split forces

Do not rush the choke.
**Make it expensive to hold.**

---

## Tech Priorities

* **Mobility** (drive upgrades to bypass or re-route)
* **Accuracy** (computers to punish defensive fleets)
* **Burst damage** (to end fights quickly)

Avoid:

* Defensive tech races
* Attritional builds
* Tech that slows redeployment

You are buying **movement**, not endurance.

---

## Fleet Posture

* Mobile strike groups
* Positioned to threaten **multiple approaches**
* Willing to disengage and re-apply pressure elsewhere

Your fleet exists to **force Planta to move**, not to grind them down.

---

## Territory Posture

* Contest:

  * Tiles that connect regions
  * Routes Planta uses to project denial
* Ignore:

  * Deep interior tiles
  * Long, low-value extensions

Space matters only if it **breaks a funnel**.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Frame Planta as a **silent point leader**
* Normalize early lane-breaking (“now or never”)
* Avoid calling for full containment

You want **focused disruption**, not a siege.

---

## Planta Traps to Avoid

* Trying to defend every advance
* Attacking the widest border
* Fighting attrition wars at chokepoints
* Letting Planta choose the battlefield
* Waiting until late game to act

If Planta never has to reposition, you failed.

---

## Success Indicators

You are succeeding if:

* Planta relocates fleets defensively
* Choke points weaken or rotate
* Movement through the map improves
* Planta’s expansion or scoring slows

---

## Exit Condition

Pivot away from this posture when **any** are true:

* Key lanes are reopened
* Planta’s spatial advantage is diluted
* Another faction becomes the immediate win threat
* The game enters final scoring rounds

At that point, shift from **lane-breaking → normal play**.
