Below is a **comprehensive, faction-specific defensive playbook for Planta**, written for players who **choose Planta** and want to survive pressure **without losing their spatial advantage or getting carved up piecemeal**.

Applies to **Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy** (and *Second Dawn*).

# Choke, Don’t Clash

## Planta Defensive Doctrine (Memorize This)

> **Planta does not defend by resisting force.
> Planta defends by making force choose another route.**

## Faction Reality (Read First)

Planta does not defend by winning battles.
Planta defends by **controlling movement**.

Your power comes from:

* cheap influence
* wide borders
* forcing opponents to fight **where you choose**

If you fight everywhere, you lose.
If you make movement painful, you win without fighting.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this playbook when **any** are true:

* A neighbor begins probing your wide borders
* You are pressured on multiple fronts
* An aggressive faction pushes into your space
* The table starts viewing your sprawl as “too big”

Planta defense begins **before** attacks land.

---

## Threat Model

Planta is attacked via:

1. **Border probing** to find weak tiles
2. **Deep strikes** aimed at cutting territory
3. **Tech-driven breakthroughs** to punch holes
4. **Containment** to stop further expansion

Opponents assume your space is fragile.
Your job is to prove it is **inconvenient**.

---

## Primary Objective

**Deny efficient movement through your territory.**

## Secondary Objectives

* Preserve influence advantage
* Avoid decisive fleet engagements
* Force attackers into bad logistics

Planta defense is **terrain control**, not force projection.

---

## Engagement Rules (Very Important)

### Fight ONLY if:

1. The fight occurs at a **choke point**
2. The fight blocks movement or supply
3. Losses are capped and acceptable

### Refuse combat if:

* The fight is deep in enemy space
* The fight is symmetric
* The fight doesn’t change movement options

If a battle doesn’t restrict future movement, it wasn’t worth it.

---

## Acceptable Loss Threshold

* Acceptable: **1–2 interceptors**
* Risky: **1 cruiser** (only at a decisive choke)
* Unacceptable:

  * Multi-round attrition
  * Losing fleets defending low-value tiles
  * Capital ship losses

Planta wins by **being annoying, not heroic**.

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 1–2 Rounds)

* Identify and fortify **2–3 critical choke points**
* Pull fleets off marginal borders
* Consolidate forces where movement converges
* Build starbases only where they *force* decisions

If forced to choose:

> Abandon space, not chokepoints.

---

## Tech Priorities (Defensive)

* **Drive** (rapid reinforcement)
* **Hull** (variance reduction)
* **Computers** (deterrence reliability)

Delay:

* Weapon races
* Expensive fleet tech
* Deep tech-track pushes

Your tech should say: *“You can’t pass cheaply.”*

---

## Fleet Posture

* Small to medium fleets
* Positioned at movement funnels
* Designed to survive and block, not chase
* Ready to retreat and re-block elsewhere

Planta fleets are **gates**, not swords.

---

## Territory Posture

* Defend:

  * Tiles that connect multiple regions
  * Routes leading toward your core
* Abandon:

  * Long, thin extensions
  * Tiles that increase border count without leverage

Wide does not mean exposed—**wide means selective**.

---

## Diplomatic Actions

* Frame your expansion as “natural”
* Encourage aggression elsewhere
* Avoid antagonistic language
* Let others believe attacking you is “possible later”

You want opponents thinking:

> “We’ll deal with Planta someday.”

That day should never arrive.

---

## Psychological Discipline (Where Planta Players Fail)

**DO NOT:**

* Try to defend every tile
* Counter-attack emotionally
* Split fleets thinly
* Fight to “prove” your space is defended

Planta loses when it fights like Orion instead of **like terrain**.

---

## Transition Rule

This defensive posture ends when:

* Borders stabilize
* Opponents stop probing
* The game enters late scoring rounds

At that point:

* Shift from blocking → locking
* From deterrence → point conversion
* From fleets → monoliths and sectors

---

## Success Indicators

You are defending correctly if:

* Attacks slow or stop
* Opponents route around you instead of through you
* Your influence remains flexible
* You keep scoring without fighting
